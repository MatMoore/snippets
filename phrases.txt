Anything for my princess!

I'm tired, I'm wasted, I love you darling.

You don't understand anything, man. Leave your *stupid* comments in your pocket!

She's a stupid bitch. She wants to control my life. I'm not going to put up with that. I'm going to do what I want to do, and that's it. What do you think I should do?

I did not hit her, it's not true! It's bullshit! I did not hit her! I did *not*. Oh hi, Mark.

Denny, two is great, but three is a crowd.

You are lying! I never hit you! You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

Oh man, I just can't figure women out. Sometimes they're just too smart. Sometimes they're flat-out stupid. Other times they're just evil.

Everybody betrayed me! I fed up with this world!

As far as I'm concerned, you can drop off the Earth. That's a promise.

I just needed some money to pay off some stuff.

Maybe you should have a girl, Mark.

I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off!

Thank you honey, this is a beautiful party! You invited all my friends. Good thinking!

Of course what do ya think? They already put my ideas into practice. The bank saves money and they are using me and I am the fool.

That son of a bitch told me that I would get it within 3 months. I save them bundles. They're crazy. I don't think I will ever get it. They betray me, they didn't keep their promise, they trick me and I don't care anymore.

Men are assholes. Men and women use and abuse each other all the time, there's nothing wrong with it. Marriage has nothing to do with love.

Hey everybody, I have an announcement to make. We're expecting!

I got the results of the test back - I definitely have breast cancer.

You are the cause of all this!

Why, Johnny? Why? Johnny, why? Why?

If you think I'm tired today, wait until you see me tomorrow.

Hi, doggy!

People are people. Sometimes they just can't see their own faults.


You are lying! I did not hit you! You are tearing me apart, Lisa!

That's the idea!

Don't touch me motherfucker.

I did not hit her, it's not true! It's bullshit! I did not hit her! I did not-- Oh hi, Mark.

You are just chicken! Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep!

That's me!

I have news, everybody. We're expecting!

Every body betray me! I fed up with this world.

How was work today?
Oh pretty good. We got a new client... at the bank. We make a lot of money.
What client?
I can not tell you, its confidential.
Oh come on. Why not?
No I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?

Do you want me to order a pizza?
Whatever, I don't care.
I already ordered a pizza.
You think about everything, ha ha ha.

I used to know a girl, she had a dozen guys. One of them found out about it... beat her up so bad she ended up at a hospital on Guerrero Street.
Ha ha ha. What a story, Mark.

When is the baby due?
There is no baby.
What? What are you talking about?
I told him that to make it interesting.

You can come out now, Johnny. She's gone.
In a few minutes, bitch.
Who are you calling a bitch?
You and your stupid mother.

Wow. So, uh, you gonna be ready?
How do you mean that? I'm always ready... for you.
