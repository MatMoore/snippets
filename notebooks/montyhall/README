This script shows how the odds vary with the number of doors in the problem.

If you have lots of doors, sticking with your first choice gives you a very
low success rate. It doesn't matter how many doors you remove,
because Monty will never remove your door, so its probability of containing
goat is unchanged (second plot).

On the other hand, switching will always increase your chances, and your
success rate depends on the number of goats that are removed (first plot).
